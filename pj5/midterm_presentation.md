## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 ViTPose Integration

The system utilizes ViTPose, a state-of-the-art pose estimation framework based on Vision Transformers:

```python
# ViTPose Model Architecture
class ViTPoseDetector:
    def __init__(self, config_file, checkpoint_file):
        self.pose_model = init_pose_model(
            config_file, 
            checkpoint_file, 
            device='cuda:0'
        )
    
    def detect_pose(self, image):
        pose_results, _ = inference_top_down_pose_model(
            self.pose_model,
            image,
            person_results=None,
            bbox_thr=0.3,
            format='xyxy',
            dataset='TopDownCocoDataset'
        )
        return pose_results
```

### 3.2 Key Point Detection

The system detects 17 key points following COCO format:

$$\text{KeyPoints} = \{p_i = (x_i, y_i, c_i) | i \in [1, 17]\}$$

Where:
- $x_i, y_i$: 2D coordinates
- $c_i$: Confidence score
- $i$: Key point index

### 3.3 Pose Classification Algorithm

For each pose type, we define geometric relationships:

$$\text{Pose}_j = f(\text{KeyPoints}) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} w_k \cdot g_k(\text{KeyPoints})$$

Where:
- $f$: Classification function
- $w_k$: Weight for geometric feature $k$
- $g_k$: Geometric relationship function
- $n$: Number of geometric features

### 3.4 Data Sieve Implementation

To address the challenge of distinguishing meaningful movements from random actions, we implement a data sieve:

```python
class DataSieve:
    def __init__(self, min_frequency=0.01, min_duration=0.5):
        self.min_frequency = min_frequency
        self.min_duration = min_duration
    
    def filter_movements(self, pose_sequence):
        # Frequency filter
        frequency = self.calculate_frequency(pose_sequence)
        if frequency < self.min_frequency:
            return None
        
        # Duration filter
        duration = self.calculate_duration(pose_sequence)
        if duration < self.min_duration:
            return None
        
        return pose_sequence
```

**Mathematical formulation for frequency filtering:**

$$f_{\text{pose}} = \frac{N_{\text{pose}}}{N_{\text{total}}}$$

Where:
- $f_{\text{pose}}$: Frequency of specific pose
- $N_{\text{pose}}$: Number of frames with this pose
- $N_{\text{total}}$: Total number of frames

**Duration filtering:**

$$T_{\text{pose}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \Delta t_i \cdot \mathbb{I}[\text{pose}_i = \text{target\_pose}]$$

Where:
- $T_{\text{pose}}$: Total duration of pose
- $\Delta t_i$: Time interval for frame $i$
- $\mathbb{I}[\cdot]$: Indicator function

## 4. Challenges and Limitations

### 4.1 Movement Detection Limitations

**Challenge**: Movement detection does not account for all psychological actions. The actual effectiveness of judging psychology through relative space changes between 17 nodes is yet to be validated.

**Technical Limitation**: 
- Limited key points (17 vs. full body complexity)
- 2D analysis vs. 3D psychological space
- Temporal dynamics not fully captured

**Mathematical Representation**:
$$\text{Complexity Gap} = \frac{\text{Psychological States}}{\text{Detectable Poses}} \gg 1$$

### 4.2 Ambiguity in Pose Interpretation

**Challenge**: A scratch of the head may indicate confusion or simply an itchy scalp. Context and frequency analysis are crucial.

**Solution**: Implement multi-level filtering:

1. **Frequency Analysis**: Discard low-frequency movements
2. **Duration Analysis**: Filter out very short movements
3. **Context Analysis**: Consider surrounding poses and temporal patterns

### 4.3 Complex Emotional States

**Challenge**: Single movements are easy to interpret, but real-life situations are much more complex. Combined emotions cannot be seen as simple linear combinations.

**Mathematical Model**:
$$\text{Emotion}_{\text{combined}} \neq \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot \text{Emotion}_i$$

Instead, we need a non-linear model, the FFN of a transformer would be great:
$$\text{Emotion}_{\text{combined}} = f_{\text{non-linear}}(\text{Pose}_1, \text{Pose}_2, ..., \text{Pose}_n, \text{Context})$$

If introducing an LLM API proves to be too great a task, we may use Pytorch to implement small-scale FFN to demonstrate the general idea.

### 4.4 Model Limitations 

**Current State**: Using only pre-trained models without fine-tuning
**Limitation**: May not produce optimal results for specific psychological analysis tasks
**Constraint**: 2-week project timeline prevents extensive fine-tuning

## 5. Advanced Technical Solutions

### 5.1 Large Language Model Integration

To address the complexity of psychological interpretation, we plan to integrate open-source LLM APIs:

```python
class LLMAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
        self.model = model_name
        self.prompt_template = self.create_prompt_template()
    
    def analyze_pose_sequence(self, pose_sequence):
        prompt = self.generate_prompt(pose_sequence)
        response = self.call_llm_api(prompt)
        return self.parse_psychological_analysis(response)
    
    def create_prompt_template(self):
        return """
        Analyze the following pose sequence and provide psychological insights:
        
        Pose Sequence: {pose_sequence}
        Context: {context}
        
        Please provide:
        1. Primary emotional state
        2. Confidence level (0-1)
        3. Supporting behavioral indicators
        4. Potential psychological implications
        """
```

### 5.2 Multimodal Transformer Architecture

For future enhancement, we propose a multimodal approach:

$$\text{Multimodal Output} = \text{Transformer}(\text{Pose Features} \oplus \text{Temporal Features} \oplus \text{Context Features})$$

Where:
- $\oplus$: Feature concatenation
- $\text{Pose Features}$: 17 key point embeddings
- $\text{Temporal Features}$: Sequence modeling
- $\text{Context Features}$: Environmental and situational context
